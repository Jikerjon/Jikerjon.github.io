            <p class="post-content">This is my second day working on this project
            and I have to say that I am really finding this interesting. It is a good
            feeling to be learning a new skill for my future and to gain an ability
            that can be used as a foundation for my future career pathway.</p>
            <p>In 4 days I am off to Waikato University which will be a brand new
            adventure for me. I will have to get acclimatised to all the hardwork,
            the new people, the new enviroment and all the partying.</p>

            <p class="post-content">I have finally found something to do with the spare time
              that I have. I have decided to learn different types of coding, it may not look
              the best now but I am sure that in a month or two my coding and programming skills
              will have improved leaps and bounds. (Well thats if I stick with it.) This is my
              journey to wed development.</p>
            <p>I am doing this so when I am up at Uni I will have a hobby that will help in my
              future endevours. I hope to be able to make simple games and websites with the techniques
              I have learnt on mimo.</p>
